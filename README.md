# EspressoInAction
The main intent of this project is to familiarize myself with the Espresso API and its usage. As well as to get a chance to practice MVP one more time. However, I decided to make this short app even more challenging by adding a little bit of material design. Specifically, I wanted to implement a bottom sheet which allows to customize and order a coffee.

I want to give a credit to [this guy](https://github.com/saulmm/From-design-to-Android-part1) because without his [article](http://saulmm.github.io/from-design-to-android-part1), which I highly recommend to read, I wouldn't have done this feature.
